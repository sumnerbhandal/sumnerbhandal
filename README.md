### Hi, my name's Sumner 👋🏽

I'm a product specialist who designs experiences, interactions and implementation strategies that look to solve the everyday problems that we have learned to work around.

Previously working to keep students safe online and offline at Education Technology company Impero Software. More recently helping to scale a leading e-commerce retailer and build better processes at Next

My current challenge is to help make contracts simpler for all at Robin AI.
